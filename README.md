# Brubeck Project Manager

Here are the commands that I think Brubeck should have. Some work has been done
and some of that will be carried over.

Create a new Brubeck environment, which is basically just a virtualenv:

    $ bpm new_env <env_name>

To start a project: 

    $ bpm new_project <project_name>
    
To start Brubeck:

    $ bpm up
    
To start 4 Brubeck instances:

    $ bpm up 4
    
    
## Mongrel2

Mongrel2's existance will be somewhat hidden behind bpm. So will Brubeck's,
except for the simple fact of implementing our website in it.
